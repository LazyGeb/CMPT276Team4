<h2 id="release-2"><strong>Release 2</strong></h2>
<h2 id="summary-of-changes-from-previous-release"><strong>Summary of changes from previous release</strong></h2>
<p>Almost all the planned use cases from release 1 have been completed. The first feature that has not been completed is the backwards function due to unexpected development issues. Our original design did not show the sprites correctly and had memory errors so we had to brainstorm new designs, which lead to development being delayed. We have started development again and will complete the feature by the next release. The last feature that has not been completed was the visualizer showing keyboard input as time did not permit for the development of this feature. It has been added to our backlog and will be completed for the next release.</p>
<p>These delays do not affect our schedule much as we have completed the assembler ahead of schedule. The assembler is written in java and is fully functional and ready to be used for game development. For our visualizer, we have implemented a pause, play and step forward functionality. The display of the memory, stack and registers are also fully functioning.</p>
<p>All major bugs from last release have been fixed. Specifically, sound now works with external roms and the speed of the keyboard has significantly improved. Refer to the <a href="#Emulator-bugs">document</a> for a detailed list of the bugs fixed. Minor bugs like the the ball glitching when hitting the paddle will be added to the backlog and fixed for next release. The rom still has to be copy and pasted in to a text file to be run.</p>
<p>For testing, last release we decided to assign someone to research on jest and if it was worth using. The results from that was it was too time consuming to use jest and the google chrome debugger will do the job just fine. As a result, for the future releases, we will be using the google chrome debugger to test out or code.</p>
<p>For our next release, it will be the same as we have planned. We will have the game snake done and polished with no bugs. Any bugs and features unfinished from this release will also be completed for next release.</p>
<h3 id="list-of-all-system-changes">List of all system changes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>UI: New Icon buttons for the visualizer and improved keyboard input</li>
<li>Emulator: Clearer graphics and sound works</li>
<li>Visualizer: Added play, pause, step forward functionality and display of stack, register and memory.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="readme-emulator"><strong>README Emulator</strong></h2>
<p>The development of the Emulator has been fully completed in terms on functionality. The bugs from release 2 have been completed except two minor bugs.</p>
<p>To run the emulator, follow these instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open index.html in google chrome</li>
<li>Click on “choose file” under file input</li>
<li>Navigate to the rom folder and open the maze.txt example file</li>
<li>Dismiss the alert and press the start emulation button</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="readme-assembler"><strong>README Assembler</strong></h2>
<p>The assembler follows instructions from the following reference: <a href="http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#memmap">http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#memmap</a>. The assembler transforms assembly language instructions into chip8 supported opcodes. For example it will take SE V3 VA and output 53A0. Because we have created our own assembler, the assembly language used has been slightly modified from the reference noted above.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-run-it">How to run it:</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the same folder as this document, you’ll find a .jar file and an intellij project folder.</li>
<li>To run assembler, navigate to your java environment and run something like the following command: java -jar Chip8 Assembler.jar “fileDirectoryForAssemblyLangFile.txt”</li>
<li>The assembler will place your opcode file in the same folder as the .jar file. It will be named programFile.txt</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The assembler reads in 1 line at a time, so only place 1 instruction per line.</li>
<li>It then splits the line into tokens, using the space “ “ as a separator.</li>
<li>When writing instructions, only place 1 per line and separate each part of the instruction by a space, nothing else (no commas).</li>
<li>Please see the exampleAssembly.txt file for an example of each instruction being used.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="readme-testing"><strong>README Testing</strong></h2>
<p>The html page will have a button called &quot;Run Opcode Tests&quot;, which will automatically test all the opcodes to see if it passed or failed. Please use the Google Chrome browser. To see wheter the opcodes have passed or not, right click and select inspect. Then go to the console tab in the inspector and this will display text as to if the tests have passed.</p>
<h2 id="emulator-bugs"><strong>Emulator Bugs</strong></h2>
<p>These bugs have been found through unit testing and integrated testing by using public domain roms provided through the following website: [<a href="https://www.zophar.net/pdroms/chip8/chip-8-games-pack.html">https://www.zophar.net/pdroms/chip8/chip-8-games-pack.html</a>]</p>
<h3 id="fixed-bugs-from-last-release"><strong>Fixed bugs from last release</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Sound works with the automatized testing and in external roms.</li>
<li>Improved input keyboard delay from 70ms to 0.6ms on average</li>
<li>Game can be loaded one after another without any glitches.</li>
<li>Score updates in games (Pong, Brix)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="bugs-that-have-not-been-fixed"><strong>Bugs that have not been fixed</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Clicking the run emulator multiple times causes it to glitch</li>
<li>Paddle graphics glitch when the ball hits it</li>
<li>Rom input currently does not work properly. The input has to be copy and pasted to text files in order to run.</li>
<li>Games don’t end after all lives have been used up.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="new-bugs"><strong>New bugs</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Log delay in visualizer lags the entire program substantially</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Chip-8 is an interpreter, which was developed in the 70s to run programs such as games like Pong, Tetris, and Pac-Man.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to develop an interpreter like the original Chip-8 and two games to play with it. Our first game will be snake, which is more of a classic game. Whereas, our second game will be more of a newer, contempory game with retro aspects. This game will be a recreation of the hit game Flappy Bird. In order to simplify the development of these games, we will create an assembler and visualizer to help create and debug the game.</p>

<h3 id="details-of-our-software-methodology">Details of Our Software Methodology</h3>
<p>For our use, <em>incremental development</em> is the most efficient and effective methodology as we will be testing for each release and making sure it is able to submit by each release. It also allows for improvements on the features, which means we can get feedback and make any necessary changes if time permits.</p>

<h3 id="meeting-schedule">Meeting Schedule</h3>
<p>We have decided to meet every week on <em>Monday</em> at <em>3:30</em> o'clock in a meeting room that we can find.</p>
<h3 id="communication-and-software-repository">Communication and Software Repository</h3>
<p>We will be communicating via <em>Slack</em> at least once a day and use <em>Trello</em> to track our development progress and status.</p>
<p>We will be working in a <em>GitHub</em> repo.</p>
<h2 id="hardware-and-software-requirements"><strong>Hardware and Software Requirements</strong></h2>
<h3 id="testing-methods">Testing Methods</h3>
<p>Automatized tests will be written in Javascript and ran on Chrome to see if there are any runtime errors.</p>
<p>We will be engaging in three types of testing to ensure the validation of our program. These three types are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Unit Testing</em> - each feature will be tested individually by the programmer in charge of the feature. This will be done while the programmer is developing the feature by writing automated tests using the Jest  framework</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Integration Testing</em> - where the features for one major component of the program are combined and automated tests are written for that component. This will be done by the member who has been assigned the role of tester and will commence when all the features for a component have been completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>System Testing</em> - where all the components of the program are combined into one program and tested. This will be done by the member who has been assigned the role of tester and will commence once the visualizer and emulator has been completed as these two parts go together.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="main-language-and-libraries">Main language and libraries</h3>
<p>We will be using <em>Javascript</em> in order to render the virtual machine. To debug our code, we will be using the <em>Chrome Browser</em>.</p>
