<h2 id="release-3"><strong>Release 3</strong></h2>
<h2 id="summary-of-changes-from-previous-release"><strong>Summary of changes from previous release</strong></h2>
<h3 id="what-was-implemented"><strong>What was implemented</strong></h3>
<p>The backwards step has been completed and fully tested. It works with all the games. We were able to optimize it to make it more efficient so that it does not use as much memory. Previously, it would go up to 3-4gb of memory.</p>
<p>We also optimized keyboard input and UI. For the keyboard input, the changes were specific to the wait key. Previously, it would keep on running the same opcode until the key was hit but now the system actually pauses until a keyboard is hit. This prevents the emulator from making redundant calls. The buttons for the visualizer controls have also been improved. You cannot click the play and forward buttons without pausing first. The buttons will be greyed out if the user is not allowed to click it. This improves the user experience so they will not try to click buttons that they aren’t allowed to. Another improvement to the visualizer is when users click the start emulation without any ROMs running, the screen will prompt them to load a ROM.  There were also many bugs fixed and this will be outlined in the <a href="#Emulator-bugs">bugs section</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-not-implemented"><strong>What was not implemented</strong></h3>
<p>The completion of Snake has not been completed.  We have begun development of it but due to the overwhelming number of bugs and optimizations, we are behind schedule. Planning and designing for snake required some time as well. Since the bugs have been fixed, we will have two people developing Flappy Bird and another two working on Snake. The remaining two will work on perfecting the program for the final release.</p>
<p>Showing the keyboard input will not be implemented in the system, unfortunately. We have tried it out on the visualizer but it causes the website to lag. As a result, we decided to no longer include it in the use cases.</p>
<h3 id="list-of-all-system-changes"><strong>List of all system changes:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>UI: Buttons will be grayed out if user is not allowed to click button. Number of opcodes that show in the log has been decreased.</li>
<li>Emulator: WaitKey pauses the whole system until a key is pressed instead of re-running the same opcode.</li>
<li>Visualizer: New default screen and step backwards button has been completed.</li>
<li>Snake: Set up the game. Snake shows on screen but cannot move yet</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="readme-emulator"><strong>README Emulator</strong></h2>
<p>The development of the Emulator has been fully completed in terms on functionality. The bugs from release 2 have been completed except two minor bugs.</p>
<p>To run the emulator, follow these instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open index.html in google chrome</li>
<li>Click on “choose file” under file input</li>
<li>Navigate to the rom folder and open the maze.txt example file</li>
<li>Dismiss the alert and press the start emulation button</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="readme-visualizer-step-controls"><strong>README Visualizer Step Controls</strong></h2>
<p>The visualizer has pause functionality, resume functionality and step forward functionality. All of this is indicated within the log as well. The step backwards functionality will be done for next release.</p>
<p>To use the step controls, follow these instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>While the emulator is running, click on the pause icon (two vertical bars)</li>
<li>While the emulator is in the pause state, you may either press the resume icon (arrow to the right),the step forward icon (the &quot;+1&quot; icon) or the step backwards icon (the &quot;-1&quot; icon)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="readme-assembler"><strong>README Assembler</strong></h2>
<p>The assembler follows instructions from the following reference: <a href="http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#memmap">http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#memmap</a>. The assembler transforms assembly language instructions into chip8 supported opcodes. For example it will take SE V3 VA and output 53A0. Because we have created our own assembler, the assembly language used has been slightly modified from the reference noted above.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-run-it">How to run it:</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the same folder as this document, you’ll find a .jar file and an intellij project folder.</li>
<li>To run assembler, navigate to your java environment and run something like the following command: java -jar Chip8 Assembler.jar “fileDirectoryForAssemblyLangFile.txt”</li>
<li>The assembler will place your opcode file in the same folder as the .jar file. It will be named programFile.txt</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The assembler reads in 1 line at a time, so only place 1 instruction per line.</li>
<li>It then splits the line into tokens, using the space “ “ as a separator.</li>
<li>When writing instructions, only place 1 per line and separate each part of the instruction by a space, nothing else (no commas).</li>
<li>Please see the exampleAssembly.txt file for an example of each instruction being used.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="readme-testing"><strong>README Testing</strong></h2>
<p>The html page will have a button called &quot;Run Opcode Tests&quot;, which will automatically test all the opcodes to see if it passed or failed. Please use the Google Chrome browser. To see whether the opcodes have passed or not, right click and select inspect. Then go to the console tab in the inspector and this will display text as to if the tests have passed.</p>
<h2 id="readme-snake"><strong>README Snake</strong></h2>
<h2 id="emulator-bugs"><strong>Emulator Bugs</strong></h2>
<p>These bugs have been found through unit testing and integrated testing by using public domain roms provided through the following website: [<a href="https://www.zophar.net/pdroms/chip8/chip-8-games-pack.html">https://www.zophar.net/pdroms/chip8/chip-8-games-pack.html</a>]</p>
<h3 id="fixed-bugs-from-last-release"><strong>Fixed bugs from last release</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Clicking the run emulator multiple times causes it to glitch</li>
<li>Paddle graphics glitch when the ball hits it</li>
<li>Rom input currently does not work properly. The input has to be copy and pasted to text files in order to run.</li>
<li>Games don’t end after all lives have been used up.</li>
<li>Log delay in visualizer lags the entire program substantially</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="fixed-bugs-that-were-found-this-release"><strong>Fixed bugs that were found this release</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Page crashes after a few minutes when left open because of the backwards step was using too much memory.</li>
<li>Could click step forward, backwards and play even though the program was not paused</li>
<li>Faulty wait for key, which did not work the external roms.</li>
<li>Many external ROMs would not work. These games were:

<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Chip-8 is an interpreter, which was developed in the 70s to run programs such as games like Pong, Tetris, and Pac-Man.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to develop an interpreter like the original Chip-8 and two games to play with it. Our first game will be snake, which is more of a classic game. Whereas, our second game will be more of a newer, contempory game with retro aspects. This game will be a recreation of the hit game Flappy Bird. In order to simplify the development of these games, we will create an assembler and visualizer to help create and debug the game.</p>

<h3 id="details-of-our-software-methodology">Details of Our Software Methodology</h3>
<p>For our use, <em>incremental development</em> is the most efficient and effective methodology as we will be testing for each release and making sure it is able to submit by each release. It also allows for improvements on the features, which means we can get feedback and make any necessary changes if time permits.</p>
<h3 id="our-roles">Our Roles</h3>
<p>Gabe: Project Manager/UI</p>
<p>Calvin: Tester</p>
<p>Mathieu: Developer</p>

<h2 id="monitoring-and-reporting-mechanisms"><strong>Monitoring and Reporting Mechanisms</strong></h2>
<h3 id="meeting-schedule">Meeting Schedule</h3>
<p>We have decided to meet every week on <em>Monday</em> at <em>3:30</em> o'clock in a meeting room that we can find.</p>
<h3 id="communication-and-software-repository">Communication and Software Repository</h3>
<p>We will be communicating via <em>Slack</em> at least once a day and use <em>Trello</em> to track our development progress and status.</p>
<p>We will be working in a <em>GitHub</em> repo.</p>
<h2 id="hardware-and-software-requirements"><strong>Hardware and Software Requirements</strong></h2>
<h3 id="testing-methods">Testing Methods</h3>
<p>Automatized tests will be written in Javascript and ran on Chrome to see if there are any runtime errors.</p>
<p>We will be engaging in three types of testing to ensure the validation of our program. These three types are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Unit Testing</em> - each feature will be tested individually by the programmer in charge of the feature. This will be done while the programmer is developing the feature by writing automated tests using the Jest  framework</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Integration Testing</em> - where the features for one major component of the program are combined and automated tests are written for that component. This will be done by the member who has been assigned the role of tester and will commence when all the features for a component have been completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>System Testing</em> - where all the components of the program are combined into one program and tested. This will be done by the member who has been assigned the role of tester and will commence once the visualizer and emulator has been completed as these two parts go together.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="main-language-and-libraries">Main language and libraries</h3>
<p>We will be using <em>Javascript</em> in order to render the virtual machine. To debug our code, we will be using the <em>Chrome Browser Development Tools</em>.</p>
